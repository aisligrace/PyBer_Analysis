# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 
## Analysis Overview

We completed a project to analyze all of PyBer’s rideshare date from January to May 2019, using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and matplotlib. Once we completed that, summary Dataframes categorized by city type. And we created a graph to show fare by city type. 

## Results

The first thing we wanted to do was make a summary dataframe that broke out number of rides and average fares by city type. 
We found that the city type ‘Urban’ had the most number of rides - by a significant amount- but also had the lowest fare per driver, at $16.57 and the lowest fare per rider, at #24.53. Rural cities had the highest fare per driver ($55.49) and for rider ($34.62), but the fewest number of overall rides. Suburban was in the middle for everything.
