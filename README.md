# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 
## Analysis Overview

We completed a project to analyze all of PyBer’s rideshare date from January to May 2019, using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and matplotlib. Once we completed that, we created a summary Dataframe to categorized by city type and average fares. And we created a line chart to show fare by city type. 

## Results

The first thing we wanted to do was make a summary dataframe that broke out number of rides and average fares by city type. 
We found that the city type ‘Urban’ had the most number of rides - by a significant amount- but also had the lowest fare per driver, at $16.57 and the lowest fare per rider, at #24.53. Rural cities had the highest fare per driver ($55.49) and for rider ($34.62), but the fewest number of overall rides. They also had the overall lowest number of drivers, while urban had the highest number of drivers. Suburban was in the middle for everything.

Second, we worked to create a line chart, plotting total fares by city type. Like our summary data frame, 'Urban' the highest.

## Summary

My three recommendations to the PyBer CEO would be to:

1) Start a marketing program to recruit more drivers in rural areas. There is a shortage of drivers and is leading to very high prices for riders, which might make them take alternative transportation. 

2) My second recommendation would be to limit new driver employees in urban cities. If these cities become too saturated with drivers, the price for riders will be too low to be profitable for drivers and PyBer. 

3)I believe that the sweet spot between driver availablilty and rider profitability is the 'suburban' city type. I would do a deeper dive into what PyBer is doing to recruit, train, and advertise in those areas and 1)keep doing it and 2)try and apply it to 'rural' and 'urban' city types.
